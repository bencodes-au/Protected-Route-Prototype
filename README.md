# Protected-Route-Prototype
Building a tutorial prototype for a protected route using Javascript, Express, Jsonwebtoken and dotenv. This was made for a Technical Blog Post as part of my study at Coder Academy. 

This project was later expanded on by adding a front end using React and Vite, to be used to develop skills for containerisation using Docker.
